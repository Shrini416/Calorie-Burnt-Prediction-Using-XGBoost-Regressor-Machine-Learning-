Calories Burnt Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the number of calories burned during physical activities based on various input features. The project leverages data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced machine learning techniques to build a robust predictive model.

üìù Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a regression model that predicts calorie expenditure using physiological and activity-related data. This notebook provides a comprehensive pipeline, including data cleaning, analysis, model training, and evaluation.

üöÄ Technologies Used
Python Libraries:
pandas, numpy for data manipulation
matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization
scikit-learn and xgboost for machine learning
Jupyter Notebook for development
üìä Steps in the Project
Data Exploration:

Loaded and examined the dataset for missing values, distributions, and relationships between features.
Conducted exploratory visualizations to identify key patterns.
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values (if any), encoded categorical features, and normalized/standardized numerical features.
Split the data into training and testing subsets.
Modeling:

Built a regression model using XGBoost Regressor to predict calories burned.
Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation were performed to improve model accuracy.
Evaluation:

Assessed model performance using metrics like R¬≤ Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Visualized feature importance and model predictions for better interpretability.
